            <p>
              My professional career began in the IT field when I joined the
              Marine Corps in 2015. Throughout this period, I mastered key
              skills including technical troubleshooting and team collaboration.
              Once my service ended, I continued my career in the IT field while
              working multiple jobs focusing on customer service, system
              administration, and device management. After approximately 6 years
              in the IT field, I had a strong desire to use more of my
              creativity and troubleshooting skills. I chose to transition to
              web design and development because it allows me to incorporate my
              creativity while still utilizing some of the key technical skills.
              I learned throughout my experience in IT. I graduated from
              National University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in digital media
              design. Additionally, I obtained my Full-stack Web Development
              certificate through the Grace Hopper Full stack Web development
              program to further my knowledge of the field and master the
              necessary skills.
